# HackOn

At HackOn, we have different tracks. Your project need not be focused on solely one track, it could be an amalgamation of several tracks. These tracks have been chosen on the basis of the problems we all are facing due to the pandemic, and how technology can be utilized in such cases.

1.Healthcare and Technology
2.Supporting At-Risk or Quarantined People
3.Improving Awareness and Behaviour
4.Working Remotely
